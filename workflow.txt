## getting fix reports without dataviewer
## Laurel Brehm, summer 2022

## step 1: convert files using edfConverter or edf2asc

## step 2: using terminal, navigate to path where files live 
cd Desktop/missingEDFs/ 
 
## step 3: run this in terminal to extract relevant lines for each file
for f in *.asc  				  	## will operate on all asc files in folder
do	
	fm="${f%.*}"
	grep 'RECORD\|IMGLOAD\|EFIX' "$f" > "$fm.out.txt"   ## extract lines containing RECORD (start trial), IMGLOAD (screen swap) and EFIX (end of fixation) and save them as .txt file
	sed -i -e 's/^/'"${fm}"' /' "$fm.out.txt"    	## add the file name to use as recording session label later
	sed -i '' 's/EFIX/x NA x/g' "$fm.out.txt"	 	## these and next lines are cleanup to play nice in R
	sed -i '' 's/FILL/NA NA NA NA NA NA /g' "$fm.out.txt"
	sed -i '' 's/IMGLOAD/NA/g' "$fm.out.txt"
done
rm *txt-e						## remove extra files that get created along the way

## step 3: run R script asc2fix.R
(Note that this is somewhat optimized for study where there is a synch message sent mid-trial. Can simplify otherwise)
